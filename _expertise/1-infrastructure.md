## Infrastructure experts

A common made mistake is the idea that containers will magically solve all sorts of infrastructure problems. But this is not true. You still need to take care of storage, networking, load balancing etcetera. And what about service discovery, logging and monitoring and auditing? We have years of experience building public and private PaaS platforms. 

So we do know how to integrate container based infrastructure in your existing landscape. And it's not only about tooling: we worked with all sorts of storage systems and network equipment. Moving to containers also means making changes to your current infrastructure. We can help you with that.
