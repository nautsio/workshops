## Containers

Technologies like Docker and Rocket are radically changing the way software is delivered. Instead of deploying development artifacts on pre-configured servers, developers and operations now work together and deliver containers that can be run anywhere.

But there are still challenges: running containers in production is still hard. Spinning up a container on a laptop is easy, but what if you want to run several containers belonging together on multiple hosts? How do they find each other? And what runs where? Software like Mesos and Kubernetes is making this easier, but there is still work to be done.
