[Terraform](https://terraform.io) by the awesome guys at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com) is a tool that lets you code your infrastructure.
In this workshop you'll learn how to use Terraform to build and update your infrastructure and to get an overview of the dependencies between all resources in your infrastructure.
